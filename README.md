Question 1 : The snappingSheetController Widget Class is used to implement the controller
pattern in the library,it controls the  snap positions of the snapping sheet
it has snapPositions property which can hold the  snap positions of the sheet
and it also has a snapToPosition method which can change the snap position

Question 2:
The SnappingSheet class has a snapPositions Property which is a list that holds the diffrent
snapping positions for the SheetBelow..

Question 3: InkWell and GestureDetector do more or less the same thing (provide the same features)
 except that GestureDetector is more broad and can provide more complex options,The InkWell is a
 child of the material widget,the advantage of GestureDetector over InkWell is that it provides
 more gestures and that its doesnt need to have a Material ancestor.
 on the other hand InkWell is a rectangle area of Material that responds to ink splashes,so it has
 effects such as ripple effect tap and other ink related features that arent found in gesture.
